### Introduction

So, some days ago, me and and a friend were trying to bring back our old CS:S surf server. So we were finding everything relevant to our last backup we could find, however, there were some obscure C++ sources we really needed to compile, and those would compile to a [Valve Server Plugin (VSP)](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_plugins).

I've been in the source engine modding scene for some time, and VSPs were always something "less talked about", and today I could the reason why.
[SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) is a great alternative yes, but in this specific case, I really needed to compile these VSP plugins.

- My goal: Compile a C++ VSP that requires steam-runtime linking and such..
- My experience: have to deal with horrible/incomplete valve docs, pain in the ass to setup, trial and error...

**So, in this blog post, I'll try to show you a quick sample of how you can compile your own VSP for a CS:S server.**

### Problems

I've used this guide: <https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013> and <https://github.com/XutaxKamay/ValveServerPlugin> for my first attempts. Ended up in a situation where I could not compile my plugin code (that requires C++17) because steam-runtime's g++ is like 10 years old, and the runtime is very old as well. Also found out that you have to run the runtime??? They implemented containerization off all of [this](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/sniper/sdk/-/blob/steamrt/sniper/README.md)? "sniper", "scout" or "soldier" different SDK builds? 

### Setup

Prerequisites:
- g++-multilib
- gcc-multilib
- schroot
- A VSP sample source code: <https://github.com/roby2014/ValveServerPlugin>

### Compiling

So 
- Clone [steam-runtime](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/tree/master) repo, we'll need a script from there.
- Install a recent snapshot of steam-runtime sysroot sniper SDK, you can find them [here](https://repo.steampowered.com/steamrt-images-sniper/snapshots/).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime
wget https://repo.steampowered.com/steamrt-images-sniper/snapshots/0.20220119.0/com.valvesoftware.SteamRuntime.Sdk-amd64%2Ci386-sniper-sysroot.tar.gz
```

Now, you can just run this to create a chroot environment:
```bash
steam-runtime/setup_chroot.sh --amd64 --tarball com.valvesoftware.SteamRuntime.Sdk-amd64,i386-sniper-sysroot.tar.gz
```

Compile the plugin:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roby2014/ValveServerPlugin
cd ValveServerPlugin
schroot --chroot steamrt_scout_amd64 -- g++ -std=c++17 -m32 -Ofast -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc -shared -o sample_plugin.so main.cpp
```

After this step, you should have a new object file named `sample_plugin.so`. This is your plugin. Now just move it alongside with it's `.vdf` to `cstrike/addons`.

Restart server and boom (it should work):
```sh
plugin_print
Loaded plugins:
---------------------
0:      "ValveServerPlugin Blog post roby."
---------------------
```

If it crashes or logs something like:
```
server_srv.so loaded for "Counter-Strike: Source"
 failed to dlopen /home/container/cstrike/../cstrike/addons/sample_plugin.so error=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/container/cstrike/../cstrike/addons/sample_plugin.so)
 failed to dlopen /home/container/hl2/../cstrike/addons/sample_plugin.so error=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/container/hl2/../cstrike/addons/sample_plugin.so)
 failed to dlopen /home/container/bin/../cstrike/addons/sample_plugin.so error=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/container/bin/../cstrike/addons/sample_plugin.so)
Unable to load plugin "../cstrike/addons/sample_plugin"
 failed to dlopen /home/container/cstrike/addons/metamod/bin/linux64/server.so error=/home/container/cstrike/addons/metamod/bin/linux64/server.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
Unable to load plugin "addons/metamod/bin/linux64/server"
```
It probably means that you skipped a step.

### Conclusion

Seriously, if you want to mod source engine games, take a look at [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) or [MetaMod](https://www.sourcemm.net/) first, VSPs are hard to setup and you will work with stuff that is (probably) easily implemented in SourceMod.
