Hi! I'm Roberto, a 19 years old student doing a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at [Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL)](https://www.isel.pt/).

This blog is mainly used to document my projects/experiments on the different topics I find interesting.
At the moment, my main interests are: **reverse engineering**, **compilers**, **emulators**, **FPGAs** and **CTFs**.

Check [my github](https://github.com/roby2014) for some of my public projects.
