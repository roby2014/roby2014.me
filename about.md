computer science & engineering bsc; 22 years old; from portugal and romanian roots

currently working as a systems software engineer

this blog is mainly used to document my projects/experiments on the different topics I find interesting, such as **reverse engineering**, **compilers**, **emulators**, **embedded systems**, **linux** and **FPGAs**...

i'm also a clarinetist and saxophonist exploring all sorts of music from balkan, romani, drone, ambient to.. noise, mid-west emo, screamo, math/post-rock, etc. i also find creative expression through video fx and editing in my free-time.

check [my github](https://github.com/roby2014) for some of my public projects.
